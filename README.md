Dark Souls II Automatic Save Backup
=============

##### Description
This is the source code for my Dark Souls II Automatic Save Backup program. This is written in C# targetting .NET 4.5.

I created this program primarily for myself. I have been using other programs, but have wanted a program with a GUI interface that has a few more elaborate features than simply copying files from one directory to another. As such, I made this.

##### Key Features
Compared to other DS2 save backup programs, this has all of the standard plus a few unique features:

* GUI!
* Automatic save directory detection
* Customizable backup frequency (in minutes)
* Backup file size tracking
* Easy way to manually clear out all existing backups
* Optional automatic cleanup of old backups (in terms of number of backups kept - option to keep under a file size coming soon)
* Support for multiple save files
* Instant backup option when you need a quick backup
* Instant restore option, which will replace your saves with your most recent backups

##### Bugs/Comments
If you come across any bugs (and there should be plenty!) or have comments, especially feature suggestions, feel free to contact me (info below). I managed to implement everything that I needed to the level I wanted, but I am more than willing to extend what I have for other people.
